# Car Rental System

## Introduction
The Car Rental System is a user-friendly desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing. The system allows users to manage a car rental service efficiently, providing an intuitive interface for booking cars, returning them, and managing customer and vehicle information.

## Features
- **Customer Management**: Add, edit, and delete customer information through a user-friendly interface.
- **Vehicle Management**: Add new cars explicitly via the application interface and manage car details easily.
- **Booking System**: Rent out vehicles to customers and track rental history seamlessly through interactive dialogs.
- **Return System**: Manage the return of vehicles and calculate rental fees with ease.
- **Dynamic UI**: A visually appealing interface that makes the system easy to use with proper spacing, padding, and intuitive layout.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Developed using Java with object-oriented principles for modularity and maintainability.
- **Java Swing**: For creating an interactive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI).
- **File I/O**: Data persistence is handled using file input/output to store customer and vehicle data.



### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `CarRentalSystem.java` file to start the application.

### Usage
- The application presents a menu-driven interface where users can navigate through different options like booking a car, returning a car, and managing customer/vehicle details.
- Follow on-screen prompts to perform desired actions.

## Sorting Visualizer

### Introduction
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work. The application visually demonstrates the sorting process step by step for algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

### Features
- **Visual Sorting**: See the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports a variety of sorting algorithms.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the input data to see how different algorithms perform on various datasets.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core logic and algorithms are implemented in Java.
- **JavaFX/Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the sorting process.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `SortingVisualizer.java` file to launch the visualizer.

### Usage
- Select a sorting algorithm from the interface.
- Watch the visualization of the sorting process in real-time.
